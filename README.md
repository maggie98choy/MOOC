MOOC (Massive open online course) is an online course aiming at large-scale interactive

participation and open access via the web. MOOC&#39;s offer the ability to create a new course as

well at the same time we can select and drop various courses. MOOC also provides a platform

for interaction among the various users via the facility of discussion forums.

We have modeled our architecture along the lines of famous MOOC&#39;s such as Coursera. We

have achieved communication between the various technologies using the RESTful architecture.
